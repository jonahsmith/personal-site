Discretionary funding has long been seen as a source of corruption in New York
City politics. Over the last 10 years or so the City Council has made
legislative efforts to address misuse.

In my [final story](/files/council-spending.pdf) for the class "Explanatory
Journalism in Politics and Policy" at the Columbia Graduate School of
Journalism, taught by The New York Times columnist Thomas Edsall, I used NYC
budget data to investigate whether there were any noticeable differences in
spending patterns after the new rules went into effect. I also used historical
documents to investigate the history of misuse and the legislative process that
led to increased oversight and spending reform.

The analysis included cleaning, standardization, matching council members'
records between years and geocoding the recipients of council funding.

The analysis was carried out in R, and the source code and data are available
[here](https://github.com/jonahsmith/discretionary-funding).
