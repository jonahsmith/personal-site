For my [undergraduate honors thesis](/files/thesis.pdf) in sociology, I used a
large nationwide dataset to investigate the relationship between early
non-cognitive traits--characteristics like social skills and
conscientiousness--and later high school graduation.

The project allowed me to combine the content knowledge in social
stratification and education I acquired through my sociology major with
statistical and computational techniques I acquired through my statistics
major. It set the stage for my interest in the intersection of society, data,
computation and sense-making that brought me to Columbia's Journalism and
Computer Science graduate program.

Some statistical techniques I used in the analysis include:

* Multiple imputation through chained equations
* Principal Components Analysis (and other dimensionality-reduction techniques)
* Interaction effects
* Mediation analysis

I also won a research grant from Columbia College to fund access to scientific
computing servers required for the imputation.
