I'm a [product-minded](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/the-product-minded-engineer/) software engineer at The New York Times working on projects to help readers better understand and navigate the news. I work across the technical stack to create the tools and formats editors use to deliver compelling experiences to readers, most recently as tech lead for live coverage in support of a [major newsroom initiative](https://www.nytco.com/press/an-update-on-newsroom-leadership/).

Before joining The Times, I led the technology team at MoMath, the National Museum of Mathematics. I have masterâ€™s degrees in computer science and journalism from Columbia University, and undergraduate degrees in statistics and sociology, also from Columbia.
