[BuroHappold Engineering](http://www.burohappold.com) is an international
multi-disciplinary engineering firm that works with premier contractors and
architecture firms to make ambitious building plans a reality. While working
with the Sustainability Team at BuroHappold's New York City offices in summer
2014, I spearheaded several initiatives to bring data-driven approaches to the
company's workflow.

One such project was this building usage scheduler. A common task for clients
is to send information on the projected daily use of a building to the
Sustainability Team for use in energy modeling. The current workflow is
cumbersome. I was tasked with imagining and prototyping a new web system
allowing clients to provide scheduling information to the Sustainability Team.

## How it works

By studying the current ways of providing scheduling information to BuroHappold
and the ways that the Sustainability Team inputs scheduling data into their
modeling system, I developed a three-tiered approach.

1. Create daily schedules for different day types.
2. Create weekly schedules composed of different day types.
3. Create yearly schedules composed of different week types.

The project was given only a few days, but I developed working proofs of
concept for the first and second tiers. Though they do not interact with each
other yet (day types defined in the prototype cannot be used in the weeks), the
proof of concept was very well received by the team. Some even suggested I
develop an offline version for internal use. (I did not have an opportunity to
do so.)

On the daily scheduling page, users can click and drag hours to modify the
occupancy levels (as a percentage of capacity) throughout the day. The save
button writes the updated information to a file on the server using a Ajax
request and a PHP script on the server. (The plan was to set up alerts to be
sent to BuroHappold email addresses when files on the server were modified.)

On the weekly scheduling page, selecting different "day types" from the
dropdown menu changes the shape of the line according to the schedule for the
day types. I did not have time to implement a save functionality for this
interactive tool.

## Example

### Daily scheduler

The opening screen is a visualization of the occupancy level by time of day.

Users may drag the circles to change the occupancy levels of hour intervals.

Pressing the save button sends an Ajax request to write the changes to the
server.

### Weekly scheduler

The opening screen is a visualization of the occupancy levels over the course
of the week.

Users may click drop-down menus to change the day type for each day of the week.

## Why it matters

This tool is an example of interactive design that allows the user to both
explore and contribute information. Because users are able to modify the
graphic and submit responses to the server, the technology could be used as a
graphically-driven survey, which is especially useful for providing complex,
unintuitive information. The graphic facilitates interaction between
organizations and their users.
