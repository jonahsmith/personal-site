In mid-2019, I was brought on as a founding member of a small experimental team called Storylines, which was tasked with working closely alongside the newsroom to develop modules and tools to help readers navigate and understand the news.

The team was the first in recent NYTimes history to apply the flexibility of newsroom engineering tooling to the product engineering space, which allowed us to quickly and iteratively launch and test new editorial capabilities and reader-facing features. The team was also innovative in that it launched one of the first TypeScript microservices at the company, a service used as an upstream of the primary GraphQL content-delivery service that performs dynamic rule-based mapping between top level asset types (such as articles) and contextual data (such as menus or brief guides).

I also led the scaling of these successful prototypes and bringing them to the platform, conceptualizing and architecting the data format and building the serialization and publishing portions of the custom content management system.

Though formally acting as an engineer, I also made a number of product contributions, perhaps most notably the live updates block.
