At *The New York Times* Student Journalism Institute in Tucson, AZ during
Summer 2015, I considered the question, "have patterns of business development
in Tucson changed with the introduction of the new streetcar system?" To begin
exploring the answer to this question, I scraped all available data on business
licenses issued by the City of Tucson going back to 2011. The analysis included
combining, cleaning, geocoding and filtering the businesses by proximity to
streetcar stations. The locations of streetcar stations were extracted from
Google Transit Feed Specification data.

The analysis was carried out over the course of approximately a week using a
combination of standard command-line tools and R. The work led to a

rends-will-demonstrate-sun-link-systems-economic-impact-in-coming-years/) that
appeared in the print and online editions of the Institute's publication as
part of a news package on the streetcar, along with a methodological [blog
post](http://tucson15.nytimes-institute.com/2015/05/28/charting-business-growth-
and-going-back-to-geometry/) that appeared online. The code used for the
analysis was released to the public via a [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/jonahsmith/tucson-business-licenses).
